What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git will create its special directory .git and its
associated subdirectories.  You need to do this so that git can track all of the changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary store whereas the repository and working directory are
permanent.  The value it brings is that it handles marshalling all of the files together into
a commit for you - you just have to worry about one file at a time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Simply by using git diff --staged.  This will separate out the changes that you have
currently in your files with those that you wish to commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If I wanted to try something experimental, but also wanted to continue to make
changes to the non-experimental code, then branching would be prefect.  The
branches would allow me to track changes for each of the individual histories,
and merge them together if I so chose.
