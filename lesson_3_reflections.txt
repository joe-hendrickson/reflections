When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

The first reason is when you are collaborating with someone or a group of people.  The
second would be whenever you want to have your work available from any system.  Come
to think of it, I'm not sure why you wouldn't want to have a remote repository - seems
like more interesting answers if you ask the question "when would you want to keep all
of your work local instead of using a remote repository"?
